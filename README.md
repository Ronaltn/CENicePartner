### Framework
* [Smart Device Framework] - The Smart Device Framework is aimed at developers wanting to simplify and reduce the cost of their development experience using the .NET Compact Framework.

* [Compact Framework In The Hand] - A set of APIs for Windows Mobile and Windows Embedded devices for .NET Compact Framework 3.5 and later.

### ADO.NET
* [System.Data.SQLite] - System.Data.SQLite is an ADO.NET provider for SQLite.

* [SQLiteWrapper] - A wrapper library for SQLite that builds on .NET 2.0 and up, including Compact Framework

### ORM
* [OpenNETCF.ORM Framework] - The OpenNETCF.ORM library is a lightweight object-relational mapping framework designed for use with the .NET Compact Framework, the full .NET Framework and Mono for Android (a.k.a. MonoDroid) and Mono for iOS (MonoTouch).

* [NDataBase] - NDatabase is a easy to use .NET Object Database. To avoid impedance mismatch overhead between Object and Relational worlds, give a try to NDatabase. NDatabase is a new generation Object Database: a real native and transparent persistence layer for .NET.

* [DapperLite] - a very simple object mapper for .NET, .NET Compact Framework and Mono.

* [EntityFramework.SqlServerCompact] - Entity Framework Core SQL Server Compact provider.

### IoC
* [OpenNETCF.IoC Framework] - The OpenNETCF.IoC Framework it is a public-domain-licensed (you can't get any more free and unencumbered than that) framework written in C# (framework version 3.5) that provides both inversion of control and dependency injection for applications.

* [Ninject] - Ninject is a lightning-fast, ultra-lightweight dependency injector for .NET applications. It helps you split your application into a collection of loosely-coupled, highly-cohesive pieces, and then glue them back together in a flexible manner. By using Ninject to support your software's architecture, your code will become easier to write, reuse, test, and modify.

### Serialization
* [Json.NET] - Popular high-performance JSON framework.But only 3.5.8 version supports Windows CE

### Logger
* [log4net] - Like version 1.2.11 can be used, but now can not get the file compiled from the official website.

* [XLogger] - Similar to log4net, you can consider trying.

* [Smart Thread Pool] - Smart Thread Pool is a thread pool written in C#. It is far more advanced than the .NET built-in thread pool.But provide only limited support for Windows CE.
